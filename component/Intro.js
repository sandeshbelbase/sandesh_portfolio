        A frontend-heavy Software Engineering enthusiast with a strong focus on user-centric,
modern, and scalable web applications. Recent graduate in Master of Information
Technology at King's Own Institute, I bring both academic and industry experience
in crafting performant frontend interfaces using technologies like React.js, Next.js, Redux,
HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript (ES6), MUI, and Bootstrap. In addition to frontend strengths, I
am expanding my backend knowledge with Python and RESTful API development. I have
collaborated closely with backend teams,
actively contributing to API integrations, and have a growing interest in full-stack
development
